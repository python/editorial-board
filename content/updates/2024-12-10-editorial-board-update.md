### Notes


* Is what we’re doing fulfilling the purpose of the EB?
    * We have been very casual 
    * We can be more proactive instead of waiting to be asked for a decision.
    * Tables vs two-line summary: [https://discord.com/channels/935215565872693329/935215566334079058/1313842986836037683](https://discord.com/channels/935215565872693329/935215566334079058/1313842986836037683)
    * Indecisions about docs are blocking contributions
    * Diataxis says to make plans and decisions, not sweeping changes
* Log of decisions:
    * We have the changelog [https://python.github.io/editorial-board/changelog/](https://python.github.io/editorial-board/changelog/)
    * People might want a one-size-fits-all decisions but 
* Churns for docs is different with code churns
    * Maybe we’d be more open to it? 
* We can be more proactive instead of reactive
    * Still mention that please don’t make PRs just to make sweeping changes to conform to the new styling decisions
    * How to be more proactive: just be more active on the Docs discourse. We can say “the board discussed it and …”
* Docs audit?
    * Get more of a plan on how to proceed from Joanna
    * Docs needing fixing: Argparse, asyncio, Threading (incl. concurrent.futures)
* Request decision
    * Request for decision: how should we mark up types in parameter lists?
    * [https://github.com/python/editorial-board/issues/7](https://github.com/python/editorial-board/issues/7) 
    * Make it a formal decision:
        * Use the word or instead of |
        * Instead of | None, use “optional”?
        * Use “default” instead of “optional”
* We are moving to Tuesdays
    * Next meeting is Tuesday Jan 14
* We should discuss docs issues more instead of personal projects
