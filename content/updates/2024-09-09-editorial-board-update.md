### Attendees

* Guido
* Mariatta
* Carol
* Ned


## Notes

* Discuss past action items.
* Catch up about last month:
    * Outline about the DevGuide 
    * DevGuide GitHub project (who will create?)
    * Write the issues (who will write?)
    * Do we publish changes as they are ready, or do we wait until entire reorg is finished?
        * What about existing URLs? (urls from other existing pages)
        * Since we are on readthedocs, it can be mapped from there -> redirect to new pages
        * You can mark pages as orphaned on Sphinx(?) Cam/Hugo might know
        * Do we need to convince others about this approach?
* Publicize the fact that we are actively reorganizing the DevGuide into Contribution Guide (TODO: Ned will start a Discourse thread, and will send a link)
* Some things that document what’s changed between Python versions are better off in the same VCS as the code. Things in the current DevGuide are like that.
  So we need to define what belongs in Contrib Guide vs CPython docs. Example: Irit’s project is better documented within CPython’s doc.
* We should go into detail: what our workflow is, and explain where to go for different docs, where are things documented.
* We like the idea of publishing in progress. Unsure about url remapping right away.
* Are we still using the “devguide” sub url? -> should it be “contributing” subdomain.
  * “Devguide” is well known terminology among existing contributors.
  * “Contributors” vs “contributing” . python org url -> can cause confusion when typing out the url
  * We like “contrib” contrib.python.org is chosen as the new url.
* Adding a big banner on top saying this doc is being actively re-org.
* We might not want to render pages that are not really ready to be published. (by adding to conf.py ignores)? But also why not render those? When will we render those?
* Another idea: add new pages to main branch, add to “do not render” list, have 2 different rtd sites built using the same repo, different config.
* Sphinx has “if” conditional 
* Who’s available and can do this work during the Sprint? 
    * Mariatta, Ned (remotely)?
* There will be a period of when both versions exist, and we want to keep this period short.
* Tools available to make both versions work.
