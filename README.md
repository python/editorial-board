## Writing new content

Hugo is not needed to be installed in order to write a new meeting minutes.

Write the meeting minutes a markdown file under ``content/updates/*.md``, commit, and
create the pull request. A preview will then be generated on Netlify.

The meeting minutes should be written using template provided in [archetypes/updates.md](/archetypes/updates.md).

If you have Hugo installed, a new meeting minutes file can be created by typing on the command line:

```
hugo new content content/updates/newupdate.md
```

This will create the file under ``content/updates/newupdate.md``, and you can continue editing it.

(replace "newupdate.md" with the desired filename.)

### Updating the Meeting Attendee List

The list of attendees is pulled from the ``"members"`` field in the frontmatter. By default, it lists all members
of the Python Docs Editorial Board. If a member did not attend the meeting, remove from this list.

## Building the static site locally

1. First install Hugo.

2. Run the command at the root of the repository:

```
hugo server
```

## Writing new changelog

Use the template in [archetypes/changelog.md](archetypes/changelog.md).

The file can also be created using the command:

```
hugo new content content/changelog/newchangelog.md
```

It will create a new file under ``content/changelog/newchangelog.md``. (Replace "newchangelog.md" with the desired filename).
